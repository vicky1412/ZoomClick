# ZoomClick

Hi friends,

This application proves that how i am lazy.

Its an automatic zoom meeting launcher at a specified time and automatically quit the meeting.

Process : Wait for the specified time and triggered
          request to the meeting link(in my case greatlearning.in)
          it will login in automatically.
          It checks for the feedbacks if it exits then it will automatically give feedback
          Switch to the ongoing class
          click on the join meeting
          meeting will started
          after specific time 
          it leaves the meeting by killing the zoom.exe from taskmanager.
          
  I hope you like it.
  
  language : python
  
  module used : pynput, threading, subprocess, requests, etc.
  
  Thank you,
